## Core Ideas
1) Players use Barbie’s creativity to design unique outfits by choosing styles, names, and trend scores, which are added to the boutique's inventory.
2) Players select and present outfits in fashion shows to gain fame, and boost Barbie's designer level, helping expand the boutique’s success.
3) The game uses a menu-driven or GUI interface to guide players through designing, and showcasing fashion in a cycle that simulates real-world fashion business dynamics.
